It aims to train a model to differentiate between instances, pulling representations of similar pairs closer together while pushing dissimilar pairs further apart in a feature space. This approach is particularly useful for **self-supervised learning**, where labeled data is scarce or unavailable.\n","\n"],"metadata":{"id":"_WeArZ2xxYOg"}},{"cell_type":"markdown","source":["## Tasks\n","   * Investigate training of different neural network achitectures with and without usage of Contrastive Learning.
