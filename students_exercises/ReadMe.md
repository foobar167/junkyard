# Study topics and tasks for students

Requirements for completing tasks: computer, webcam, Google Mail account.

There are three learning strategies to choose from:
A.	Study each exercise carefully and perform each one.
B.	Choose one topic and focus on studying it. In the best case, we’ll start writing a joint research article (academic paper) on the chosen topic.
C.	Combined option. Quickly familiarize yourself with the proposed tasks and concentrate on studying one topic. With the possibility of writing a research article.

Most likely we’ll choose the second strategy (option B) for topics 7 and 8.

The following topics are available for study:
1.	Classification of three-dimensional (3D) medical images. File "01_3D_image_classification.ipynb".
2.	Implementation and launch of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN). A simple version of GAN and a more advanced one. Files "02.1_Simple_GAN_example.ipynb" and "02.2_DCGAN_example.ipynb".
3.	Image processing with Python without neural networks. File "03_Image_processing_with_Python.ipynb".
4.	OpenCV features detectors and descriptor extractors algorithms with GUI. File "04_OpenCV_feature_detectors_and_descriptor_extractors.ipynb".
5.	Implementation and experiments with ReAct (reasoning and acting) AI (artificial intelligence) Agent. File "05_AI_Agent.ipynb".
6.	Generating heat maps using neural network class activation maps. File "06_Heatmap_using_CAM.ipynb".
7.	Independent work on assignment. Self-supervised contrastive learning code example. Directory "additional_data/Contrastive_Learning_research".
8.	Independent work on assignment. Maps segmentation using the pipeline in file "additional_data/UNet_image_segmentation_v2.ipynb". Maps generation using the pipeline in file "additional_data/Pix2Pix_GAN_implementation.ipynb".

After your internship, you can continue your studies with the following course: "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" (https://course.fast.ai/).
