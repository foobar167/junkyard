# Study topics and tasks for students

Requirements for completing [these tasks](https://github.com/foobar167/junkyard/tree/master/students_exercises):
computer, webcam, [Google Mail](https://support.google.com/mail/answer/56256?hl=en) account.

There are three learning strategies to choose from:

<ol type="A">
   <li>Study each exercise carefully and perform each one.</li>
   <li>Choose one topic and focus on studying it.
In the best case, we’ll start writing a joint research article
(academic paper) on the chosen topic.</li>
   <li>Combined option. Quickly familiarize yourself
with the proposed tasks and concentrate on studying one topic.
With the possibility of writing a research article.</li>
</ol>

Most likely we’ll choose the second strategy (option B) for topics 7 and 8.

The following topics are available for study:

   1. Classification of three-dimensional (3D) medical images.
File [`01_3D_image_classification.ipynb`](01_3D_image_classification.ipynb).
   1. Implementation and launch of a Generative Adversarial Network (GAN).
A simple version of GAN and a more advanced one.
Files [`02.1_Simple_GAN_example.ipynb`](02.1_Simple_GAN_example.ipynb)
and [`02.2_DCGAN_example.ipynb`](02.2_DCGAN_example.ipynb).
   1. Image processing with Python without neural networks.
File [`03_Image_processing_with_Python.ipynb`](03_Image_processing_with_Python.ipynb).
   1. OpenCV features detectors and descriptor extractors algorithms with GUI.
File [`04_OpenCV_feature_detectors_and_descriptor_extractors.ipynb`](04_OpenCV_feature_detectors_and_descriptor_extractors.ipynb).
   1. Implementation and experiments with ReAct (reasoning and acting) AI Agent.
File [`05_AI_Agent.ipynb`](05_AI_Agent.ipynb).
   1. Generating heat maps using neural network class activation maps.
File [`06_Heatmap_using_CAM.ipynb`](06_Heatmap_using_CAM.ipynb).
   1. Independent work on assignment.
Self-supervised contrastive learning code example.
Directory [`./additional_data/Contrastive_Learning_research`](./additional_data/Contrastive_Learning_research).
   1. Independent work on assignment.
Maps segmentation using the pipeline in file [`./additional_data/UNet_image_segmentation_v2.ipynb`](./additional_data/UNet_image_segmentation_v2.ipynb).
Maps generation using the pipeline in file [`./additional_data/Pix2Pix_GAN_implementation.ipynb`](./additional_data/Pix2Pix_GAN_implementation.ipynb).

After your internship, you can continue your studies with the following course: "Practical Deep Learning for Coders" (https://course.fast.ai/).

P.S. There is no `models` directory, because models took up too much space.

P.P.S. Simpler tasks are placed in [`simple_tasks`](simple_tasks) directory.
