# 1. Generate keystrokes using Python + Tkinter.
# 2. Save needed keycodes in the dictionary.
# 3. Use dictionary with keycodes to handle keystrokes independently from
#    operating system, language or (maybe?) keyboard model.
# This is not an elegant solution, so I think it is better to "hardcode"
# keycodes depending on the operating system.
