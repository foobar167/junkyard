To deploy web service on Render you should have a
[separate repository](https://github.com/foobar167/web_api_for_render)
with a starter application.

It is **unnecessary** to integrate [this starter app](https://github.com/foobar167/web_api_for_render)
into a bigger project like `junkyard`, because it takes **6 minutes** to re-deploy
after each commit to GitHub.
