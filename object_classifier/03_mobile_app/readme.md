This is the [original project](https://github.com/llSourcell/image_classifier_template)
of Siraj Raval.

If you have problem with `com2` directory for Windows OS, please, use
[this issue](https://github.com/llSourcell/image_classifier_template/issues/2#issuecomment-537893334)
to fix it.

   * [Install](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install) Flutter.
     Run `flutter doctor` in console. Resolve problems with certificates and
     [plugins](https://stackoverflow.com/a/52816669/7550928).<br /><br />
     ![`flutter doctor`](data/2019.10.02_flutter_doctor.jpg)<br /><br />
   * Download and open [this code](.) in Android Studio as a new Flutter project.<br /><br />
   * It will ask you to 'get' all dependencies, say yes and it'll will all be installed automatically.<br />
     If you get error `Because flutter_app11 depends on flutter_test any from sdk which doesn't exist
     (the Flutter SDK is not available), version solving failed`. Then you need to configure path to
     Flutter in project settings: `File --> Settings --> Languages & Frameworks --> Flutter -->
     Flutter SDK path`. Enter your path to Flutter directory.<br /><br />
     ![Flutter SDK path](data/2019.10.03_flutter_sdk_path.jpg)<br /><br />
   * Run `flutter packages get` in console in [project directory](.).
     It'll update [`.packages`](.packages) file.<br /><br />
   * Replace the default render link in [`main.dart`](lib/main.dart)
     to the link to your deployed render app.<br /><br />
     ![Replace Render link](data/2019.10.03_render_link.jpg)<br /><br />
     [Dart](https://dart.dev) is a client-optimized programming language for fast apps
     on multiple platforms. It is developed by Google and is used to build mobile,
     desktop, backend and web applications.<br /><br />
   * Notice the 2 functions `user_signup` and `user_login`
     in the [`main.dart`](lib/main.dart) file.
     This is where your stripe and firebase authentication code will be placed
     to make your app commercial.<br /><br />

I excluded (commented out) user authentication code
in the [main.dart](03_mobile_app/lib/main.dart).
